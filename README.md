# CanvasR

This is an R package that deals with data exported from Canvas, the learning management system. Currently, we support importing multiple choice and true/false quizzes.

# Installing 

CanvasR is not on CRAN. You may install using [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html):

    devtools::install_github("jabranham/canvasR")

CanvasR is currently tested on Linux and macOS, but should work on Windows as well.
